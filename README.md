### <u>Market</U>

The generative AI market size is large and fast growing. It was valued at just under $USD [45 billion](https://www.statista.com/forecasts/1449838/generative-ai-market-size-worldwide#:~:text=The%20generative%20AI%20market%20is,double%20the%20size%20of%202022.)

## Competitive Landscape
MidJourney operates in the competitive landscape of generative AI and creative tools. Here are some of its key competitors:

1. Open AI([DALL-E2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2)): 

    perhaps MidJourney's biggest competitor, DALL-E2 is a powerful AI image generator by the well-funded Open AI, whose web app UI may be easier for consumers who are not already on Discord.  

2.  [Adobe Sensei](https://business.adobe.com/products/sensei/adobe-sensei-genai.html)

    Adobe sensei integratses AI into Adboe's creative suite - widely used by creative professionals across different fields. However the high cost of the app subscription may limit accessibility for some.

3. [DeepArt.io](https://creativitywith.ai/deepartio/)

    DeepArt.io specializes in style transfer, transforming photos into artworks. It is user-friendly but lacking in a wider range of functionality
4. [RunwayML](https://runwayml.com)

    RunwayML provides AI models suited for collaborative work, but the interface can be complex and potentially costly.

Despite strong competitors in the field, MidJourney remains at the forefront in the AI image generator space. Some of MidJourney's competitive edges include:
* **realistic image quality** - by using both a large language model an da diffusion model 
* **user-friendly interface** - straight-forward prompts designed for users of varying technical skills
* **community & collaboration** - Discord platform encourages users to share, learn and comment on each oher's work
* **continuing improvement in app development** - since the Beta launch in Sept 2022, MidJourney has launched 5 additional versions with significant improvement in image quality in each iteration


## Results
With about 17 millions people now using the tools, and 1 to 2 million active users, the company has projected $USD [300 million](https://www.fastcompany.com/91033497/midjourney-most-innovative-companies-2024) in annulaized revenue in 2023. As a privately-held company with no outside investors, there is little financial information avaialble to the public regarding the company.

## Personal experience & Recommendation
Having briefly experimented with MidJourey I was incredibly impressed by the quality of the images rendered in all types of styles with extremely nuanced details, as well as the speed with which the images were generated. MidJourney is an incredibly effective tool to aid in the ideation process, to test various options or to refine an idea through iterative versioning. 

Since the initial beta launch in Sept 2022, MidJourney has released 6 additional versions of its image generator. With each update the image quality continue to improve, and this continuing evolution and refinement of its product will keep MidJourney ahead of its competitors. I peronally would also love to see MidJourney delving into vidoe and animation generation as well.
